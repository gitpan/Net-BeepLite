Net::BeepLite - Perl framework for BEEP (RFC 3080).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::BeepLite::ClientSession;

  my $session = beep_connect(Host => localhost,
                             Port => 10288);

  my $channel_num = $session->start_channel
      (URI => 'http://xml.resources.org/profiles/NULL/ECHO');

  my $resp_msg = $session->send_and_recv_message
                   (Content     => "some content",
                    ContentType => 'text/plain');

  print "received response: ", $resp_msg->content(), "\n";

=head1 ABSTRACT

Net::BeepLite is a lightweight implementation of a BEEP client/server
framework.  This package is intended for implementing fairly simple
BEEP clients and servers.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::BeepLite is a "lightweight" implementation of a BEEP
client/server framework, born out of a desire to have the ability to
simple BEEP client and server work without attempting to be the last
word on BEEP in Perl.

One thing this package does is intentionally fuse the BEEP Listener
role with the Server role, and the Initiatior role with the Client
role.  That is, it makes no attempt to support the peer-to-peer
capabilities of BEEP.

Also, it has only rudimentary support for multiple channels,
especially on the server side.  In particular, by avoiding the use of
threads (or some other complicated forking scheme) it does not handle
asynchronous channels.  Ultimately, on the server side, messages on
different channels are processed serially.  This eliminates one of the
main purposes of using multiple channels.  In fact, the system
defaults not allowing clients to open more than one channel at a time.

That being said, it is possible to support multiple channels, but this
package is easiest to use when using only one.

=item beep_listen( I<ARGS> )

This is a main entry function for running a BEEP server.  It takes a
named arguement list.  It supports the following arguments, in
addition to the arguments accepted by the
C<Net::BeepLite::ServerSession> constructor.:

=over 4

=item Port

The TCP port on which to listen.

=item Address

The address to bind to, if there is more than one interface.

=item Profiles

This should be an array reference of a list of objects that inherit
from C<Net::BeepLite::BaseProfile> (or at least support the same
methods).  At least one profile MUST be supplied here, or clients will
not be able to start any channels.

=item Method

This is a string describing the multitasking method to use.  Currently
the only supported option is 'fork'.  Future options may be 'prefork'
and 'prepostfork'.

=item Socket

If you wish to use this code but want to setup the socket yourself,
you can pass the socket in using this.  If you do so, the Port and
Address parameters will be ignored.

=item Debug

If true, this will spew forth (some) stuff to STDERR.  It defaults to
false.

=item Trace

If true, this will spew forth even more stuff to STDERR, including the
entire conversation.

=back

In general, this function does not return, forming the main event loop
of the server.

=item beep_connect( I<ARGS> )

This is the main entry point for the client.  It will either return a
C<Net::BeepLite::ClientSession>, already connected to the BEEP peer,
or it will return undef and have set C<Net::BeepLite::errorstr>.

It accepts a named parameter list with the following parameters, in
addition to the parameters accepted by the
C<Net::BeepLite::ClientSession> constructor:

=over 4

=item Host

The host to connect to.

=item Port

The port to connect to.
