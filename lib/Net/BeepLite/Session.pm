package Net::BeepLite::Session;

=head1 NAME

Net::BeepLite::Session

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class for BEEP sessions.  It handles core tasks common
to both server and client sessions.  This class isn't intended to be
used directly.  Instead, use one of its subclasses.

Note that in reality, this is really a TCP session.  It is not
abstracted away from the TCP transport for BEEP.  In the future it is
possible that it will be and a new TCPSession subclass will be
created.

use IO::Socket;

use Net::BeepLite::Channel;
use Net::BeepLite::MgmtProfile;

use Carp;

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new( I<ARGS> )

This is the main constructor.  It takes a named parameter list as its
argument.  See the C<initialize> method for a list of valid parameter
names.

=cut

sub new {
  my $this  = shift;

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item initialize( I<ARGS> )

Initialize the object.  This is generally called by the constructor
and subclasses.  It takes the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item Socket

the socket associated with this session.

=item NoGreeting

Do not send the greeting message.  This can be sent later with the
C<send_greeting> method.  This will be true if a socket isn't
supplied.

Returns the internal socket.

=cut

sub _socket {

=item _set_socket($socket)

Change the session's internal socket to the supplied socket.  Only use
this if you know what you are doing.

}

=item _add_channel($channel_number, [$profile, [$local_window_size]])

This is called by the management profile upon receiving a <start> or
<profile> message from the peer.  If $profile is provided, then this
will bind that profile to the channel.

=cut

sub _add_channel {
  my $self    = shift;

=item _del_channel($channel_number)

This is called by profiles when it needs to close a channel (either a
close request on the channel or a tuning reset (see
C<_del_all_channels>).

=cut

sub _del_channel {
  my $self   = shift;
  my $number = shift;

  delete $self->{channels}->{$number};
}

=item _del_all_channels()

Close (and destroy) all current channels.  This is most likely to be
done as part of a tuning reset.

=cut

sub _del_all_channels {
  my $self = shift;

  for my $n (keys %{$self->{channels}}) {
    $self->_del_channel($n);
  }
}

=item add_local_profile($profile)

This method will add a (local) profile to the session.  This will be
advertised in the greeting message.

=cut

  my $uri  = shift;

  $self->{remote_profiles}->{$uri} = 1;

=item num_open_channels()

Return the number of open channels associated with this session.  This
does not include channel zero.

=cut

sub num_open_channels {
  my $self = shift;

  # return the number of open channels, not including channel zero.
  (scalar keys %{$self->{channels}})  - 1;
}

=item channel($channel_number)

Returns the C<Net::BeepLite::Channel> object for the given channel
number.

=cut

sub channel {
  my $self = shift;
  my $chno = shift;

  $self->{channels}->{$chno};
}

=item servername([$val])

Returns or sets the session's server name.  This is normally set when
the first "<start>" message is encountered with a "serverName"
attribute.

=cut

sub servername {
  my $self = shift;
  my $name = shift;

  $self->{servername} = $name if $name;

  $self->{servername};
}

=item send_greeting()

Send the greeting message to the peer, and handle the greeting coming
from the peer.  It will advertise any profiles that have been
configured in the session.  Normally, this method is called as part of
the initialization process of the subclasses of this class.

=cut

sub send_greeting {
  my $self = shift;

  # send the greeting message.
  $self->{mgmt_profile}->send_greeting_message($self);

  # handle the remote greeting.
  my $peer_greeting = $self->_recv_message();
  $self->{mgmt_profile}->handle_message($self, $peer_greeting);
}

=item send_message($message)

This will send a BEEP message to the peer (over the channel specified
in the message).  This will handle possible fragmentation due to the
channel window size.

=cut

sub send_message {
  my $self    = shift;
  my $message = shift;

  # if it has.  Replies (RPY, ANS, ERR, NULL) should have the same
  # msgno and the MSG to which they are replying.
  if ($message->type() eq 'MSG') {
    carp "MSG messages should NOT have a pre-set message number"
      if defined $message->msgno();
    $message->msgno($channel->next_msgno());

    my $frame = $message->next_frame($seqno, $window);
    # actually send the frame.
    $self->_write_frame($frame);
    # update our current sequence number.
    $channel->update_seqno($frame->size());
    # and adjust the remote window.
    $channel->remote_window($window - $frame->size());
  }
}


=item _recv_message()

This will fetch the next message from the peer, returning a message
object.  It will handle reassembling a fragmented message.  It will
return the first complete message received on any (existing) channel.
It will discard frames on non-existent channels, issuing a warning.

This method will block.  It will return undef if it is not possible to
read from the socket, otherwise it will return the message.

=cut

sub _recv_message {
  my $self = shift;

  # first try and return a message off the queue.
  my $message = $self->_dequeue_message();
  return $message if $message;

  # otherwise, we read one from the socket.

  # This handles interleaved frames for messages on different
  # channels, or ANS messages on the same (or different channels).
  # The channels have slots for building messages of both types.  The
  # first time we see a completing frame, we return that message.

  while (1) {
    # get the next frame from the socket (will block here).
    my $frame = $self->_recv_frame();

    # our frame will have already gone through SEQ processing.  it
    # will also have been added to the appropriate message building
    # slot.

    # message from its build slot and clear it.

	$message = $channel->message();
	$channel->clear_message();
      }

      return $message;
    }
  }
}

=item recv_message()

This will fetch the next message (on any defined channel other than
zero) from the peer, returning a message object.  It will handle
reassembling a fragmented message.  This will directly handle channel
zero messages, so this isn't all that useful for handling replies to
management channel messages.

=cut

sub recv_message {
  my $self = shift;

  my $message = undef;

  while (1) {
    $message = $self->_recv_message();

    last if $message->channel_number() != 0;

    $self->{mgmt_profile}->handle_message($self, $message);
    return 0 if not $self->_is_connected();
  }

}


=item close_session()

close the entire session.  Normally, this should only be called after
sending or receiving the "<ok>" message.  It can also be used in fatal
error situations.

=cut

sub close_session {
  my $self = shift;

  # we should have already sent or received the "ok" message by now
  # (unless we are aborting)

  confess "abort: $message\n" if $self->{trace};
  $self->close_session();

  die "aborted\n";
}


=item _read_for_seq([$channel_number])

Read frames from the socket until receiving a SEQ frame.  If
$channel_number is provided, then read until a SEQ frame on that
channel has been read.  Non SEQ frames read are place either in the
various message-building slots (see _recv_message), or place on the
general message queue.

    # if we are done.

	$channel->clear_message();
      }

      $self->_queue_message($message);
    }
  }
}

=item _recv_frame()

This is an intermediate wrapper around C<_read_frame>.  Essentially,
it reads a frame from the socket, then does a little bit of post
processing, finally returning that frame.  The processing is: if it is
a SEQ frame, it updates the channels remote window size accordingly;
if it is some other frame, it adds it to the appropriate channel's
message building slot.

It returns undef if the socket could not be read from.  It returns 0
if the frame was on a non-existent channel.

    $self->_send_seq($channel, $ackno);
  }

}

=item _send_seq($channel, $ackno)

Send a SEQ for $channel_number to the peer.  $ackno is the sequence
number to acknowledge.  Generally this is the seqno of the frame this
